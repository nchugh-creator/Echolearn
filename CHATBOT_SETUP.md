# Add to .env file
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
```

#### 2. Enable Claude 3 Access
1. **AWS Console** → **Bedrock** → **Model access**
2. **Request access** to Claude 3 Sonnet
3. **Wait for approval** (usually instant)
